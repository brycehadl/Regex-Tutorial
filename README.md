# Regex-Tutorial For Hex Value

Character combinations in strings can be matched using regular expressions, which are patterns. "Not" is indicated by the metacharacter ^ in a regular expression. Hence, "^a" denotes "do not match lowercase a," whereas "a" signifies "match lowercase a."

## Summary

I'll go over and dissect the parts of a regular expression that match hex values. A computer may be accurately informed about any particular color using the hexadecimal coding method, which guarantees precision and consistency in electronic displays. A six-digit number that comes before the # symbol in hexadecimal represents a color that can be utilized in a computer program or webpage.    Example /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors don't remotely fit any character. Rather, they align a place prior to, following, or in between characters. The regex match can be "anchored" at a certain point using them. The caret ~ corresponds to the string's initial character's position. Using ^a to match an ABC to a. Since the b cannot be matched by ^ immediately after the string's start, \b does not match any of the letters in the alphabet. The innards of the regex engine can be shown below. Likewise, $ matches immediately following the string's final character. In the ABC, c$ and c match, but a$ does not match at all.

### Quantifiers

The number of characters expected is expressed using quantifiers. The number of occurrences of a character, group, or character class that must exist in the input for a match to be found is indicated by quantifiers. Quantifiers match as many characters as they can by default because they are greedy. Regular expressions that contain the characters ",+,?,{}" are regarded as quantifiers. To match 0 or 1 times, the expression is indicated by the? As stated in the summary above, in order to differentiate between the two types of formats, we will use the or operator. The hex triplet format {6} and the shorthand hex format {3} in our Hex Value regular expression mean that the component preceding these quantifiers should have a length of 6 for {6} and 3 for {3}.
